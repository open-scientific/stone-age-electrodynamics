# Stone Age ElectroDynamics

What is meant by the title?

Well at an age and technological level(stone age), The mystery is that one kind is able to craft huge structures, with an intent that may still be misunderstood even today!

It is an exploration into the electrodynamics of the materials we can find at such sites.

Project outcomes: 
- Rediscovery of the applications of these materials in electric or magnetic or other types of energy collection/generation.

It is widely known that you cannot use rocks in your standard electrical circuits, the resistance is too great for low voltage circuits. But did you know some rocks will conduct high voltages. If thats possible what can they do in the magnetic domain? Can we harvest cosmic or earthly fields? 

Where do we see evidence:
- [500,000 volts through megalithic stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS1azzN0b-I)
- [Electromagnetic Field Experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMgbTd38ozE)
- [Brittania Article has some measurements](https://www.britannica.com/science/rock-geology/Hysteresis-and-magnetic-susceptibility)

Potential experiments:
- Apply high voltage and capture arc pattern/size.
- Apply high voltage to samples and measure arc distance.
- Apply high voltage to samples and map/measure E fields.
- Apply magnetic source to samples and map/measure M fields.
- Apply static energy to samples and measure E & M fields.

Samples: 
- Limestone
- Sandstone
- Basalt
- Granite
- Grit Stone
- Marble
- Salt Rock
- Quartz
- ...TBD

experiment expectations:
- Do samples behave according to measurements cited in 3rd parties.
- Do samples increase/decrease fields/arc vs control.
